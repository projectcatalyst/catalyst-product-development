## Current priorities



### 1. Funding categorisation & contributor funding model

* ****:white\_check\_mark: **Funding categories focus area grouping refinements** - Improvements can be made on how clear it is where specific proposals should be placed into [funding categories](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/QQsRsN95MX1ihFh4Vffn/). This refinement is important to reduce any remaining ambiguity of where to submit certain proposals into the funding categories.

* :white\_check\_mark: **Contributor and idea proposal types** - Analysis looking at whether proposal or contributor proposal types should be in separate or combined categorisations.&#x20;
  * Sources - [Combining vs Separating Idea & Contributor Proposals](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/categorisation-analysis/combining-vs-separating-idea-and-contributor-proposals)
* ****:white\_check\_mark: **Contributor model refinement** - Further improvements to the [contributor analysis](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/gdWEUdtxBpngJ9kJPPlB/) can be made in better defining the goals of the contributor model in general and for Catalyst and Cardano ecosystems and the differences between idea and contributor based funding approaches.

* ****:white\_check\_mark: **Improve analysis around addressing concerns and add analysis about handling challenging funding situations** - Improving the existing analysis on different concerns that need to be addressed relevant to funding categorisation and also adding some analysis going over potential solution options for handling challenging funding situations.
  * Source: [Approaches for directing funding](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding) (updated), [Addressing concerns & challenging funding situations](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-analysis/addressing-concerns-and-challenging-funding-situations) (updated existing content), [Not Enough Proposals Submitted](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-analysis/addressing-concerns-and-challenging-funding-situations/not-enough-proposals-submitted), [Low Quality Proposals](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-analysis/addressing-concerns-and-challenging-funding-situations/low-quality-proposals), [High Quality Proposals Cannot Be Submitted](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-analysis/addressing-concerns-and-challenging-funding-situations/high-quality-proposals-cannot-be-submitted), [Excessive Funding Requests](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-analysis/addressing-concerns-and-challenging-funding-situations/excessive-funding-requests)
* ****:white\_check\_mark: **Brief review of funding categorisation content in IOHK treasury paper** - IOHK has a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/435.pdf) called “[A Treasury System for Cryptocurrencies: Enabling better collaborative intelligence](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/a-treasury-system-for-cryptocurrencies-enabling-better-collaborative-intelligence/)” that mentions categorisations however not in much depth. A brief review can be added to outline what was mentioned in this paper, what similarities the paper has with the suggested funding categories and any improvements that could be made.

* ****:white\_check\_mark: **Fund 9 data funding categorisation update** - Based on the fund 9 results the historical data in the [funding categorisation analysis document](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/wD0ZpGoCt4aFrCJnqaW0/) can be updated to reflect the most recent data.

* ****:white\_check\_mark: **Scaling funding categories** - Add analysis outlining how funding categories can be better scaled in the future with automation of budget weighting and a reduction in the number of categories if the voting infrastructure can support a higher complexity and keep the experience easy to voters.
  * Source: [Scaling Funding Categories](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-analysis/scaling-funding-categories)
* **Funding category incentives and game theory** - Add analysis outlining the impact that the suggested categories can have. The rules and guidance added to categorisations can lead to profound impacts on the incentives and game theory involved in the funding process. Understanding this will help us better understand how it can impact how the ecosystem could be influenced by the categorisation.
* **Alternative categorisations** - Suggestions towards different categorisations that could be effective in the future such as reducing and combining some of the funding categories which have been suggested.



### 2. Catalyst product development

* **Catalyst community priority and proposal supply dynamics** - Analysis can be made on the community priority and proposal supply dynamics that exist in Catalyst that change each funding round. Priorities comes from what the community wants to see proposals for such as from setting goals and objectives, supply comes from the proposals that are submitted to cater for that demand or that tries to create its own demand.
* **The importance of standards** - Analysis covering why standards are important for project catalyst and how they can lead to interoperable systems with a wider number of different applications as the ecosystem grows.



### 3. Ongoing **work**

* **Push for funding categorisation changes** - There is a [change proposal ](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-improvement-proposals/improvement-proposals/2.-replace-challenge-setting-with-funding-categories)shared with IOG to change how funding categorisation is done in Catalyst.
* **Push for change with the need for a contributor funding model** - There is a [change proposal](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-improvement-proposals/improvement-proposals/3.-use-a-contributor-model-for-stewardship-and-delegated-authority) I have shared with IOG to push for introducing a contributor funding model to support and improvement the Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Catalyst product development roadmap** - Iterate the Catalyst product development roadmap prioritisation items with community feedback in working groups and after town halls to better understand what areas of work need to be completed.
* **Catalyst Circle communication** - Collaborate more with what is happening in Catalyst Circle and share recent work completed.



### 4. Future areas of focus

* **Proposal standards** - Start looking at defining what makes a good proposal and what a suitable data structure could be with what information should be captured and what technology can be used now and in the future to improve those standards.
* **Working structures & processes** - Analyse how the community who are working on Catalyst can most effectively collaborate and work together using certain tools, processes and governance approaches and be efficient in delivering high quality outcomes.
