# 1⃣ Funding Categorisation Analysis V1.0

The following is the work completed to get the funding categorisation analysis to a version 1.0. This work will be continued in the future after working on other more important areas in the short term.



### 1. Funding categories & Funding categorisation analysis

* :white\_check\_mark: **Funding categories focus area grouping refinements** - Improvements can be made on how clear it is where specific proposals should be placed into [funding categories](http://localhost:5000/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/QQsRsN95MX1ihFh4Vffn/). This refinement is important to reduce any remaining ambiguity of where to submit certain proposals into the funding categories.

* :white\_check\_mark: **Combining or separating contributor and idea categorisations** - Analysis looking at whether proposal or contributor proposal types should be in separate or combined categorisations.&#x20;
  * Sources - [Combining vs Separating Idea & Contributor Categorisations](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categorisation-analysis/combining-vs-separated-idea-and-contributor-categorisations)
* :white\_check\_mark: **Contributor model refinement** - Further improvements to the [contributor analysis](http://localhost:5000/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/gdWEUdtxBpngJ9kJPPlB/) can be made in better defining the goals of the contributor model in general and for Catalyst and Cardano ecosystems and the differences between idea and contributor based funding approaches.
